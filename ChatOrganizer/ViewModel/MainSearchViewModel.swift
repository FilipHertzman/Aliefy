    /// - Parameter completion: A closure that takes a `Query` object and returns void. It's called after the OpenAI API request finishes.
    /// - completion closure is marked as @escaping because it's called after an asynchronous operation - in this case, the network request to OpenAI API.
    ///   This means that the completion closure will be called at some point in the future, after performSearch has returned.
